This is an experiment that combines DefiKingdoms and ChatGPT.

I've scraped the official DefiKingdoms documentation and the official Medium introduction. I have also scraped the subtitle information from YouTube AMAs after March.

The initial intention is to hope that new players of DFK can easily get the information they want to know.

Currently, this GPT robot has been added to the DFK Chinese Discord. If you want to try it, you can join the DFK Chinese Discord.
